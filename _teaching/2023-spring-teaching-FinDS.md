This section outlines my experience as a Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course **FinDS: Foundations in Data Science** under Professor Rajiv Gandhi at the University of California, San Diego during the Spring 2023 term.

Introduction to FinDS
======

FinDS, Foundations in Data Science, is an introductory Computer Science course that explores the fundamental concepts and techniques in data science. The course is interdisciplinary, drawing on mathematics, statistics, and computer science to equip students with the skills necessary to handle real-world data analysis challenges. More information about the course and its structure can be found on the [course website](https://mathfinds.ucsd.edu/event-archive/finds-2023).

My Role as a Teaching Assistant
======

As a Teaching Assistant for FinDS, my responsibilities included:

- **Assisting with the grading of assignments** that challenge students to develop their data handling and analytical skills.
- **Providing support during office hours** to help students with coursework and projects, addressing both conceptual doubts and technical troubleshooting.
- **Coordinating with the course instructor** to enhance the curriculum and adapt teaching methods based on student feedback and performance.

Impact and Student Engagement
======

My involvement in FinDS was instrumental in helping students appreciate the value of data science in solving practical problems. The hands-on lab sessions facilitated a deeper understanding of the material, as evidenced by the progressive improvement in student assignments and project work. The interactive nature of the homeworks also encouraged active participation and engagement from the students, making it a fulfilling teaching experience.
